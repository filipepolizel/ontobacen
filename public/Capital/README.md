# Capital Module

The purpose of this module is to establish a set of **capital** definitions. Such conceptualizations are made as specialized forms of the *contextualized capital definition*, considering different aggregations of financial instruments for their accounting.

In order to achieve such objective, the **Capital** module encompasses four underlying ontologies:

- [**Tier 1 Core**](https://github.com/filipepolizel/ontobacen/tree/master/public/Capital/Tier1Core): encompasses the *core capital* definition.
- [**Tier 1 Complementary**](https://github.com/filipepolizel/ontobacen/tree/master/public/Capital/Tier1Complementary): encompasses the *complementary capital* definition.
- [**Tier 2**](https://github.com/filipepolizel/ontobacen/tree/master/public/Capital/Tier2): encompasses the *tier 2 capital* definition.
- [**Permanent Limit**](https://github.com/filipepolizel/ontobacen/tree/master/public/Capital/PermanentLimit): encompasses definitions used as capital deductors, when calculating BACEN's Prudential Regulation operational capital limits.
