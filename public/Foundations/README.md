# Foundations Module

The purpose of this module is to provide common conceptualizations shared with other *Ontobacen* ontologies.

In order to achieve such objective, the **Foundations** module encompasses six underlying ontologies:

- [**Financial Institutions**](https://github.com/filipepolizel/ontobacen/tree/master/public/Foundations/FinancialInstitutions): contains definitions for classes of financial institutions which are part of the SFN, in the same way they are defined by BACEN.
- [**Contextualized Monetary Amount**](https://github.com/filipepolizel/ontobacen/tree/master/public/Foundations/ContextualizedMonetaryAmount): make a contextualization of FIBO’s *monetary amount* definition, applied specifically to SFN's risk management.
- [**Capital Adequacy**](https://github.com/filipepolizel/ontobacen/tree/master/public/Foundations/CapitalAdequacy): responsible for defining a taxonomy of sub-classes for the *financial system governance context*.
- [**Factors**](https://github.com/filipepolizel/ontobacen/tree/master/public/Foundations/Factors): classifies entities related to numerical factors and
coefficients, present in business rules defined in BACEN’s Prudential Regulation.
- [**Relations**](https://github.com/filipepolizel/ontobacen/tree/master/public/Foundations/Relations): defines various relationships needed for association and
contextualization of concepts encompassed in another *OntoBacen* modules and ontologies.
- [**Individuals**](https://github.com/filipepolizel/ontobacen/tree/master/public/Foundations/Individuals): encompasses the definition of individuals who are explicitly mentioned in BACEN’s Prudential Regulation.
